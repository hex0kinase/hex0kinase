- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hex0kinase
- ðŸ‘€ Academic background and research in structural biophysics of membrane proteins. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and am new to GitHub as an author for 2023 as a relatively recent convert from "old DIY" mess to leveraging pythonspace goodies like conda & jupyterlab for stabile viz and collab.
- Be gentle :) old svn guy, deciding to join the gitgang.
